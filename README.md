## Latest Updates
1. Added a local large model node, currently compatible with GLM and LLM. However, LLM cannot be used for tool invocations because the native LLM does not include this functionality. Please provide the absolute paths to the tokenizer and model folders in the node to load LLM locally.
2. Introduced a code interpreter tool.
3. Enabled file loading with the option to input absolute paths.
4. Expanded the components available for the large model node, giving you more choices.

# **COMFYUI LLM PARTYâ€”A Node Library for LLM Workflow Development in ComfyUI** 

## Introduction
[comfyui](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) is an extremely minimalist UI interface, primarily used for AI drawing and other workflows based on the SD model. This project aims to develop a complete set of nodes for LLM workflow construction based on comfyui. It allows users to quickly and conveniently build their own LLM workflows and easily integrate them into their existing SD workflows.

# User Guide
[Building a Modular AI with ComfyUIÃ—LLM: A Step-by-Step Tutorial (Super Easy!)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JZ421v7Tw/?vd_source=f229e378448918b84afab7c430c6a75b)

## Features
1. You can right-click in the comfyui interface, select `llm` from the context menu, and you will find the nodes for this project. [how to use nodes](how_to_use_nodes.md)
2. Supports OpenAI API driving and custom base_url, allowing the use of a proxy API to drive LLM nodes.If you are using other large model interfaces, you can convert them to the OpenAI API format using [openai-style-api](https://github.com/tian-minghui/openai-style-api). Please select the LLM_local node for local deployment. Currently, both GLM and LLAMA have been adapted, but LLAMA cannot be used for tool invocations because the native LLAMA does not include this functionality12
3. The base_url must end with `/v1/`.
4. Supports importing various file types into LLM nodes. With RAG technology, LLM can answer questions based on file content. Currently supported file types include: .docx, .xlsx, .csv, .txt, .py, .js, .java, .c, .cpp, .html, .css, .sql, .r, .swift
5. The tool combine node allows multiple tools to be passed into the LLM node, and the file combine node allows multiple files to be passed into the LLM node.
6. Supports Google search and single web page search, enabling LLM to perform online queries.
7. Through the start_dialog node and the end_dialog node, a loopback link can be established between two LLMs, meaning the two LLMs act as each otherâ€™s input and output!
8. It is recommended to use the show_text node from [ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts) in conjunction with the LLM node for output display.

## Download
[Baidu Cloud Download](https://pan.baidu.com/s/13ogn1np6bHgxOJhS--QJmg?pwd=jppj) (Recommended! Includes a compressed package of comfyui with the environment setup completed, and a folder for this project. After downloading the former, thereâ€™s no need for further environment configuration!)

Or install using one of the following methods:
### Method 1:
1. Search for comfyui_LLM_party in the [comfyui manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) and install it with one click.
2. Restart comfyui. During the first restart, it will take some time to download the embedding model used for RAG.

### Method 2:
1. Navigate to the `custom_nodes` subfolder under the ComfyUI root folder.
2. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/heshengtao/comfyui_LLM_party.git`.
3. Copy the word embedding model to the model folder, [click the link](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-zh/tree/main) to download the model.

### Method 3:
1. Click `CODE` in the upper right corner.
2. Click `download zip`.
3. Unzip the downloaded package into the `custom_nodes` subfolder under the ComfyUI root folder.
4. Copy the word embedding model to the model folder, [click the link](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-zh/tree/main) to download the model.

## Environment Deployment
1. Navigate to the `comfyui_LLM_party` project folder.
2. Enter `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal to deploy the third-party libraries required by the project into the comfyui environment. Please ensure you are installing within the comfyui environment and pay attention to any `pip` errors in the terminal.
3. If you are using the comfyui launcher, you need to enter `path_in_launcher_configuration\python_embeded\python.exe path_in_launcher_configuration\python_embeded\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal to install. The `python_embeded` folder is usually at the same level as your `ComfyUI` folder.

## Configuration
Configure the APIKEY using one of the following methods:
### Method One:
1. Open the `config.ini` file in the `comfyui_LLM_party` project folder.
2. Enter your `openai_api_key` and `base_url` in `config.ini`.
3. If you want to use the Google search tool, enter your `google_api_key` and `cse_id` in `config.ini`.

### Method Two:
1. Open the comfyui interface.
2. Create a new Large Language Model (LLM) node and directly enter your `openai_api_key` and `base_url` in the node.
3. Create a new Google Search Tool (google_tool) node and directly enter your `google_api_key` and `cse_id` in the node.

## Next Steps Plan:
1. More common utility nodes, such as: code interpreters, text-to-speech output, recognition of text information in images, etc.
2. Allow LLM to internally call an LLM that is subsidiary to it, giving the assistant its own assistant.
3. New nodes that can connect with the numerous SD nodes in comfyui, expanding the possibilities for LLM and SD, and providing related workflows.
